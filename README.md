Using data retrieved from Scotiabank, I've put together an analysis report for my transactions from August 21, 2021 to July 7, 2022. I used wrangling skills when processing the data and used several analyzing skills while looking at the patterns of data. This project not only gave me a chance to practice and learn more new R programming skills, but also helped me keep track of my financial condition. Thanks for your time:)
